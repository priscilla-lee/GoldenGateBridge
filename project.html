  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    This was a really fun project. I incorporated many major graphics concepts that
    we learned this semester including hierarchical modeling, lighting, camera, curves,
    texture-mapping, transparency, user interaction, and animation.
  </p>

  <h1>Components</h1>
  <p>The biggest feature of my project is the iconic Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
  <img src="screenshots/bridge.png">
  <img src="screenshots/tower.png">
  <p>I also created a mini "world" (water, land, and sky).</p>
  <img src="screenshots/empty_world_side.png">
  <img src="screenshots/empty_world_above.png">
  <p>I built 5 different types of vehicles to drive across the bridge: hatchback, sedan, van, truck, and bus.</p>

  <img class="smaller" src="screenshots/van.png">
  <img class="smaller" src="screenshots/truck.png">
  <img class="smaller" src="screenshots/bus.png">
  <p>Lastly, I added a curved road, along which the vehicles could drive.</p>

  <h1>Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG and ThreeCSG)</h1>
  <p>
    I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry">constructive solid geometry</a> 
    in 2 places: the road and the bridge cables. I used <a href="https://github.com/evanw/csg.js/">csg.js</a> 
    and <a href="https://github.com/chandlerprall/ThreeCSG">ThreeCSG</a>.<br><br>

    To create the vertical cables of the bridge, I built an ExtrudeGeometry to "mask" the "bounding area"
    of the cables, and I used CSG to grab their intersection.
  </p>
  <img src="screenshots/cables_shape.png">
  <img src="screenshots/cables_masked.png">
  <p>
    I also used CSG to create the road. With a curve, I was able to create a TubeGeometry. In order to "extract" a flat
    road surface from the tube, I "intersected" it with a very flat cylinder, using CSG.
  </p>

  <h1>Shapes and ExtrudeGeometries</h1>
  <p>
    I became very familiar with  Shapes and ExtrudeGeometries, because I used them a ton in this project
    (for the land "islands" and the vehicles, for example). It was pretty meticulous drawing the shapes out, and
    determining the coordinates, and it took a lot of pencil-sketching.
  </p>

  <h1>Bezier and Spline Curves</h1>
  <p>
    In addition to incorporating a bezier curve in the bridge itself, I used curves in 2 other major places: the 
    land "islands" and the road.<br><br>

    The shapes/outlines of each of the land islands are formed from a spline curve. I attempted to create
    the road from a spline curve, but it was very difficult to "control" the curve and force it to pass
    across the bridge without wiggling. So I strung together bezier curves instead.
  </p>

  <h1>Animating along a Curve</h1>
  <p>
    Because I ambitiously decided to make a curvy road, I needed some way to animate my vehicles (and my camera)
    driving along the curve. Luckily I found <span class="monospace">curve.getPoint(t)</span> and 
    <span class="monospace">curve.getTangent(t)</span> very useful. It was very tricky to get the rotation 
    and everything working, but I'm very happy with the results.
